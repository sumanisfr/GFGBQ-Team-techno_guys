## 📌 Problem Statement
    . 
**PS-12: AI for Grievance Redressal in Public Governance**

Government bodies receive thousands of citizen grievances daily related to infrastructure, sanitation, healthcare, public safety, utilities, and administrative delays. These grievances are often unstructured (free text, mixed languages) and manually processed, which slows resolution. The lack of intelligent prioritization and routing causes delayed resolution of critical issues, citizen dissatisfaction, and reduced transparency.

**Solution:** An AI-powered system that automatically analyzes, classifies, prioritizes, and routes grievances to enable faster, fairer, and more accountable governance.

## 📖 Project Overview

SmartGov AI is an enterprise-grade AI-driven grievance redressal platform that helps government bodies automatically understand, prioritize, and route citizen complaints using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

### **How It Works:**
1. **Citizen submits complaint** via web interface with contact details
2. **AI analyzes text** using TF-IDF vectorization (30K features, 1-4 grams)
3. **ML models predict** category with voting ensemble
4. **System determines** priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low) using keyword analysis
5. **Department routing** based on category classification
6. **Sentiment analysis** evaluates citizen emotion
7. **Resolution time** estimated dynamically
8. **PDF report** generated with ticket ID
9. **Admin panel** for status updates and management

This reduces manual workload by 80%, speeds up resolution time, and improves transparency and accountability.

**🎉 Ready for Production Deployment and Hackathon Presentation! 🎉**

1. Open your browser and navigate to <http://localhost:8501>
2. Enter a grievance in the text area (e.g., "Garbage not collected for 7 days")
3. Click the "Analyze Complaint" button
4. The AI system will:
   - Classify the grievance into a category (Sanitation, Healthcare, Infrastructure, etc.)
   - Determine the priority level (Critical or Normal) based on keywords
   - Assign it to the relevant department

## 🧠 How It Work

The system uses a machine learning pipeline with:
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Converts text complaints into numerical features
- **Logistic Regression**: Classifies complaints into categories
- Trained on labeled grievance data

### Priority Detection (`utils.py`)

Keywords are analyzed to determine urgency:
- **Critical**: Contains words like "accident", "emergency", "hospital", "fire", "danger", "life", "death"
- **Normal**: All other complaints

### Department Routing (`utils.py`)

Each category is mapped to the appropriate department:
- Sanitation → Municipal Sanitation Department
- Utilities → Electricity / Water Department
- Healthcare → Health Department
- Public Safety → Police Department
- Infrastructure → Public Works Department
- Administration → District Administration
